                <p class="h6 fw-normal lh-base">Our group's project explores the extraordinary life of Jos√© Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines. This comprehensive study delves into Rizal's early years, his education, and his pivotal role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonization. By examining his literary works, including the seminal novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," we highlight Rizal's profound impact on Filipino nationalism. The project also covers his advocacy for peaceful reform and his ultimate martyrdom, which galvanized the movement for Philippine independence. Through this project, we aim to honor Rizal's enduring legacy and inspire a deeper appreciation of his contributions to the nation's history.</p>
